# SqlManip.py : will allow you to upload / manipulate/ activate sql functions, sp, and tables. Using a list containing your login/pass/url/dbName you can instantiate the Class and do basic actions on your sql database. 
# yFin.py: will allow you to dowload data using yfinance in python, prices, fundamentals, information about ETF, companies, derivatives. Offer structured BS,IS,CF statements with up to 4 years yearly data. I find it particularly useful for basic financial research or indicator computation, or even cross analysis, given the tedious learning curve on yfinance and the scarce information/guide on the web.
# InteractiveBroker.py: if you have a funded IB account, after getting connected to your computer app, you can run the code to get various information, mainly instrument characteristics or price series on all available instruments and asset classes. This script offer you the way to get started easier on ibapi and able to modelise data as you progress and get more experience.
